        <bold>Hello. Kia ora. Kia orana. I go by the moniker TCP, which happens to be the acronymn for Transmission
            Control Protocol, as well as the initials of my name. Fitting to say the least.</bold> Many years ago I
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout">burnt out</a> as a programmer, due to a combination
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor phenomenon</a>, and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a>. After which I limped on in the
        profession for a few years, on the generousity of friends, family, and strangers.
    </p>
    <p>Reflecting on the past nineteen years, I've had to the pleasure to work on many fascinating
        projects. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian">Symbian apps</a> before its sudden demise. A
        number of iPhone, OSX, and iOS apps. Educational software. An interesting viral incremental game that generated
        substantial profit for its owners. Even a Nationally significant archival project. However, I never fully
        regained the passion for writing computer code. I have spent a large segment of the past nineteen years, as a labourer, a carpenter, and a teacher. Never really, satisfied with my place in the world. Constantly searching for the passion I once had for the proclivity of programming.
    </p>
    <p>It's now week six, of our national covid-19 lockdown. As we look towards an uncertain future, I have decided to
        undertake a personal challange of writing code, every day. No matter how small. Whether that means a
        substantial number "Hello World" commits to github, then so be it. Something is better than, something else.</p>
    </p>
    <p>I have created this site, hand written, as an acknowledgement to anyone who stumbles here, from the far reaches of the internet, who shares a similar story. Stay safe.</p>
